# spec2wav

Experimenting with a neural vocoder derived from other researches
The skeleton is the same as SampleRNN, with modifications in architecture to suit my use case.

Will modify the architecture to make it extremely flexible for multiple purposes. Speech, Music, Any Other Audios, etc.

## TODO
- [ ] Generator File
- [ ] Saving Model/Loading Model
- [ ] Validation (Based on better Score)
- [ ] Generation audio every epoch
- [ ] Model Input Output Tuning
- [ ] Model Audio Lengths Equal
- [ ] HyperParameters
